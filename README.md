# weather-react-test

Write a react app that uses our weather API to show the hourly forecast for a location in a table. After a location is submitted, each hour of the forecast should be a row in the table.

Requirements:
- Use react/typescript
- Use react-redux for data flow
- Use material UI V5 where possible + datagrid for the table
- An input field to put in a latitude and longitude 
- A submit button that queries the weather at this location and shows the hourly forecast in the table

Resources:
- API documentation: https://api.weatheroptics.co/
- Weather Endpoint: https://api.weatheroptics.co/weather/forecast
- You can use this API key: fcad233e7630208c70b7517a70ed81ab

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
